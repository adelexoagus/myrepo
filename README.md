# myrepo
Hi, I'm Adele, a Computer Science student - majoring in Software Engineering. This repository is a collection of my learning projects to further build my skillset. 
Here you'll see that I'm familiar with programming languages like Java, JavaScript , Python and C#. 
I'm comfortable with front-end web development as I have knowledge of HTML & CSS as well as experience with backend development as I've created functional SQL databases.
I hope to further share more projects as my I sharpen my skills.
